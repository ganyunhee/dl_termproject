## FILES

기초딥러닝 텀과제.pdf : main documentation for this project

color_palette_generator.ipynb : main file for this project
- (supposedly) integrated file for all clustering and utilization of neural networks

color_picker.ipynb
- practice file for integrating K-means clustering with other neural networks (as of 2023-06-30, only CNN)

dataset : folder containing manually created datasets
- includes images with their corresponding color palettes (more to be added)

prereq : folder containing study materials
  - k_means_clustering_study.ipynb : study on k-means clustering
  - neural_network_study.ipynb : study on CNN, FCN, LSTM
  - opencv_study.ipynb : study on OpenCV (understanding image input and color representation)

misc : folder containing other inspiration

기초딥러닝 텀과제 제안서.pdf : PDF file for initial thoughts on project (for reference)
